              Well, howdy there! Looks like you've wandered off the beaten path
              a bit. This page seems to have flown the coop, much like Honk used
              to do with my mail before he got his act together.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't worry, it happens to the best of us. Even a future
              Postmaster General can get a little disoriented sometimes. Try
              heading back to the <Link to={"/blog"}>Blog</Link>, or maybe just
              honk really loud and see if that helps!
            </p>

    </motion.div>
