            Well, howdy there! Looks like you've wandered off the beaten path a
            bit. This page seems to have flown the coop, much like Honk used to
            do with my mail before he got his act together.

            Don't worry, it happens to the best of us. Even a future Postmaster
            General can get a little disoriented sometimes. Try heading back to
            the <Link to={"/blog"}>Blog</Link>, or maybe just honk really loud
            and see if that helps!
