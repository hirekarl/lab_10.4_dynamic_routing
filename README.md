## Assignment
You are tasked with building a small but feature-rich blog application. This will require you to implement a core feature of modern web applications: dynamic routing. You’ll create a system where a list of blog posts links to individual, dynamically generated pages for each post.

Furthermore, you will implement a basic authentication system and create a “protected” admin area that is only accessible to logged-in users, a common requirement in real-world applications.

This lab will give you hands-on experience with React Router and handling URL parameters.
